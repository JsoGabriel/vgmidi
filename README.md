# VGMIDI Dataset

VGMIDI is a dataset of 95 MIDI labelled piano pieces (966 phrases of 4 bars) and 728 non-labelled ones, all
piano arrangements of video game soundtracks. Each piece was annotated by 30 human subjects according to a
valence-arousal (dimensional) model of emotion. The sentiment of each piece was then extracted by summarizing
the 30 annotations and mapping the valence axis to sentiment. The annotation process was conducted via a
[custom web tool](https://github.com/lucasnfe/adl-music-annotation).
